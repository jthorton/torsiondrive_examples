This torsiondrive job scans over a torsion angle of a sialic acid while keeping
all other torsions frozen as well as bonds and angles within the sugar ring.

There are many constraints on the sugar ring degrees of freedom. They were defined
using trial and error. All of the bond distances, most of the angles, and alternating
dihedral angles within the ring are kept as constraints. Constraint values on the
6-membered ring come from the GLYCAM force field, which uses neutron diffraction experiments
to set the atomic coordinates of the ring.

The following line was removed from constraints.txt because it was impossible to
satisfy along with all the other constraints:
